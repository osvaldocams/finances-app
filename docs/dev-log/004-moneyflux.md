**subject**
dummy frontend implementacion form and movement view

**branch**
feat/moneyflux_form

**part**
moneyflux

**Date:** 11/13/2025

**Desccription:**
- today i createed a dummy frontend implementation for two key components of the moneyflux module
- form: setup initial tsx draft, UI oriented (no logic yet) 
- movemet view: created placeholder component to display individual movements, helps visualize how each movement will appear once real data is integrated. 


**Tecnical decisions/learnings:**
- Since this is only a draft, I kept the implementation flexible. The focus was on establishing the UI structure rather than making definitive technical choices. More detailed decisions will come later once the layout and component flow are validated.

**Difficulties:**
- I encountered minor issues while working with some CSS Grid properties. After reviewing the documentation and experimenting with a few test variations, I managed to resolve them without major complications.

**Next Steps:**
- Initially, my plan was to complete the entire frontend first. However, during development I realized that several UI areas depend on real data from the backend. Creating temporary mock files or placeholder logic would add unnecessary overhead and slow down progress. For that reason, the next step will be to start building the REST API. This will provide the real data structure needed for the frontend and will allow the upcoming components and views to be implemented more efficiently.
