REST API Tag CRUD endpoints

**Date:** Dec/18/2025

**Desccription:**
- In this iteration, I implemented the core structure for the Tags module, including its routing layer, controllers, and model-level logic. The goal was to provide a clean and independent CRUD feature that can later be integrated with the Movement domain without introducing tight coupling. This step establishes Tags as a first-class entity within the backend, making it reusable and easy to extend in future iterations.


**Tecnical decisions/learnings:**
- Implemented Tags as an independent module with its own router and controllers, instead of embedding tag logic inside the Movement routes.
- Centralized slug generation at the model level using pre-validate and pre-save hooks to ensure consistency regardless of where tags are created or updated.
- Chose to generate slugs automatically to: Avoid duplicated logic in controllers, Keep request payloads simple, Guarantee normalized tag identifiers
- Designed the CRUD endpoints to cover current needs only, intentionally avoiding over-engineering at this stage.


**Next Steps:**
- Integrate Tags with the Movement module.
