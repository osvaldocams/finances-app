# 001 - Initial Project Setup

**Date:** 24/10/2025

**Branch:** main

**Desccription:**
- I configured Tailwind version 4
- I made some adjustments to the Git configuration, necessary for the project commits, specifically I made VScode the default editor for editing commits
- I started the docs folder and the dev-log file at the root of the project, where the project activities will be recorded over time.

**Tecnical decisions/learnings:**
- For a better way to manage the project commits, I had to investigate the best way to do it, I got a template, but I didn't know how to write it when making the commit, so I found that it is necessary to do it through the code editor, so I then configured vscode as the default Git editor.

**Difficulties:**
- There were no major difficulties, except for the configuration of VScode in Git, which was easy to solve by searching on the Internet. The solution came with a simple command.

**Next Steps:**
- Tomorrow I will start with the configuration of the file environment and the router that is necessary for the structure and pagination of this project.
- I will also spend some time deciding the next steps.
