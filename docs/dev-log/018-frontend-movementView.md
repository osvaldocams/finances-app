**Desccription:**
- Implemented the first complete integration for listing movements in the frontend. This includes fetching data from the API, handling loading and error states, and rendering a summarized list of movements in the UI. The movement model was aligned with backend responses by adapting populated account references, and the UI was refined to better represent movements as a concise overview, improving readability and user experience.
