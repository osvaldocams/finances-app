# 002 - Frontend - router system / main layout

**Date:** 29/10/2025

**Branch:** feature/layout (merged to main and deleted)

**Desccription:**
- the routing system with react-router-dom was configured, using a main layout as a layer structure
- The main layout code (tsx code and tailwind styling) was written in a beta version

**Tecnical decisions/learnings:**
- A special branch was created for this feature; updates to the docs are made from this branch, although it will be modified later when it is merged with the main branch.

**Difficulties:**
- I had slight difficulties in the layout design, specifically in making the footer stay at the bottom without creating a scroll bar. I was able to solve this by adding a main div with a CSS grid structure.

**Next Steps:**
- The next step, logically, will be to merge it with the main branch.Additionally, modifications will be made to the docs folder, with a new structure for the developer log.
