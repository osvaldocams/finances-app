moneyflux

**Date:** 11/11/2025

**Desccription:**
- i made a file for a view of the movements, in this view we're gonna see all movements we made
- then I made a file 'CreateMovement' here we're gonna render a form component later
- i added to router file these two views which are connected, 'movementView' has a button to 'createMovement' and vice versa


**Tecnical decisions/learnings:**
- Basically, the most important decision was choosing the structure this part would follow to create a movement, using the facilities provided by react-router-dom.

**Difficulties:**
- At first it was difficult because I had the idea of ​​making a modal window, but through trial and error I saw that it could unnecessarily complicate the readability of the code, so i decided to use the pagination of react-router-dom

**Next Steps:**
- Nex step is to build the form component to create a movement, this case it will be just dummy code because i want to wait for the backend code what i will write in the next steps
