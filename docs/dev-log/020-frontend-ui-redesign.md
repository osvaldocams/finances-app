**Desccription:**
- This phase focused on consolidating the visual identity and responsive structure of the frontend. The main layout was redesigned, defining a consistent color palette and typography, and reorganizing the header and aside menu to work properly across screen sizes. MovementList was migrated from a table layout to a card-based grid to improve responsiveness and visual flexibility. MovementForm was visually enhanced, including the initial UI for tag selection. Finally, repeated header logic was extracted into a reusable PageHeader component and polished to reduce duplication and improve consistency across views.
