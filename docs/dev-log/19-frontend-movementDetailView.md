**Desccription:**
- Completed the Movement Detail feature on the frontend. This includes the creation of a dedicated detail view and route, integration with the API to fetch real movement data, and the implementation of the delete movement flow with user confirmation. During integration, a small refactor was performed to centralize API error handling and improve UI state management (loading and pending states), resulting in a more robust and predictable user experience.
