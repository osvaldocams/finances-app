## 📅 october 24 2025

### 🧩 Module or section:
Initial project setup

### ⚙️ Tasks done:
- I configured Tailwind version 4
- I made some adjustments to the Git configuration, necessary for the project commits, specifically I made VScode the default editor for editing commits
- I started the docs folder and the dev-log file at the root of the project, where the project activities will be recorded over time.

### 🧠 learnings / tecnical decisions:
- For a better way to manage the project commits, I had to investigate the best way to do it, I got a template, but I didn't know how to write it when making the commit, so I found that it is necessary to do it through the code editor, so I then configured vscode as the default Git editor.

### ⚠️ Difficulties encountered:
- There were no major difficulties, except for the configuration of VScode in Git, which was easy to solve by searching on the Internet. The solution came with a simple command.

### 🎯 Next step:
- Tomorrow I will start with the configuration of the file environment and the router that is necessary for the structure and pagination of this project.
- I will also spend some time deciding the next steps.

### 🧩 Module or section:
Frontend - router system / main layout

### ⚙️ Tasks done:
- the routing system with react-router-dom was configured, using a main layout as a layer structure
- The code that does the layout of the main layout (tsx code and tailwind styling) was written in a beta version

### 🧠 learnings / tecnical decisions:
- A special branch was created for this feature; updates to the docs are made from this branch, although it will be modified later when it is merged with the main branch.

### ⚠️ Difficulties encountered:
- I had slight difficulties in the layout design, specifically in making the footer stay at the bottom without creating a scroll bar. I was able to solve this by adding a main div with a CSS grid structure.

### 🎯 Next step:
- The next step, logically, will be to merge it with the main branch.Additionally, modifications will be made to the docs folder, with a new structure for the developer log.
